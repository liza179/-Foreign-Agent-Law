Unaffected Influence: The Foreign Agent Law’s Impact on Media Citation Rates

This paper aims to investigate the effect of the Foreign Agent Law on the citation rates of various media outlets. Using a Difference in Differences (DiD) approach, we hypothesize that the law’s introduction would not lead to a decrease in citation rates of affected media. In line with our expectations, the findings from our analysis support this hypothesis. The sustained levels of citation rates post-legislation indicate that the law might not have the anticipated suppressive effect, or other factors are compensating for any potential decline, maintaining the overall citation dynamics.
